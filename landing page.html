        <p>It’s better to keep checking the strategic contribution of projects, and create project plans that are flexible when requirements or priorities change.

        <p>Successful communication in PPM includes communicating project ideas from the outset, clarifying requirements and expectations with the teams, clearly addressing grievances, documenting decisions in meetings, communicating changes to all participants, meaningfully forwarding reports, and communicating even seemingly trivial things. One piece of advice is to avoid trains of thought such as “that is obvious, so I don’t need to say it.” </p>
